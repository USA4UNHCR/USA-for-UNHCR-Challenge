# Tools for Improving Refugee Outcomes Challenge

USA for UNHCR, The Hive is looking to use data, analytics and machine learning to improve the overall outcomes for refugees throughout the resettlement process, as well as change the conversation about refugees in the United States. 

The challenge objectives take a two pronged approach to moving forward USA for UNHCRâ€™s work through analytics and data research. One group of objectives will look tactically at how refugee camps can be improved by understanding the experience of refugees accessing water and sanitation amenities. Another group of objectives will take a deep look at the way media (traditional and social) discusses refugees and their experience, and how individuals interact with that media and create their own.  

Please see the challenge brief for additional information. 

The folders in this github are split between `social_listening` and `borehole_access`.
