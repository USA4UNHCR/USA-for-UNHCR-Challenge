# Borehole Access

UNHCR has the primary responsibility for coordinating, drafting, updating and promoting guidance related to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in refugee settings.

For this hackathon, we were, for the first time, able to collect extensive geolocation data for a number of refugee camps, down to individual tents. In addition, UNHCR WASH provides borehole data with detailed information about the properties, location and safe yield of the boreholes that provide water supply to millions of refugees.
